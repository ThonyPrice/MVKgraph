*Demonstration of functionality*

## Description

This repository include course work for DD1392 - Introduction to Software Engineering. 
The course was projectbased, we were assigned a client at [Findwise](https://findwise.com/en) who had a tool in mind for us to develop.
The product of project is a tool to empower recruiters at Findwise when reviewing KTH students. 
In a interactive invironment it's possible to search for courses taken by a student and find all dependecies of the course, 
that is backtrack to see all courses the student must have taken.

Product is currently available at *link coming soon*

## Implementation

1. Gather information about courses through KTH api
2. NLP of course descriptions to extract dependencies
3. Population of data and dependencies in DB (elasticsearch)
4. Make page, query data and construct grapg representation (Angular framework)
